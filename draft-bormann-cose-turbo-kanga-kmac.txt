        COSE Algorithms for KangarooTwelve, TurboSHAKE and KMAC
               draft-bormann-cose-turbo-kanga-kmac-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies or updates registrations for a number of
   Keccak-based algorithms in the COSE Algorithms Registry.

   RFC 9861 defined and registered four eXtendable-Output Functions
   (XOFs), hash functions with output of arbitrary length, named
   TurboSHAKE128, TurboSHAKE256, KT128, and KT256; the present document
   is intended as the IETF consensus document that is now needed to give
   these algorithms Recommended status in the COSE registry.

   RFC 9861 only hints at MACs that could make use of the TurboSHAKE and
   KT algorithms.  This document completes the specification of
   HopMAC128 and HopMAC256 from RFC 9861 and also specifies simpler MACs
   directly based on KT128 and KT256.  Finally, this document registers
   COSE Algorithm identifiers for the KMAC set of algorithms
   (NIST.SP.800-185).

1.  Introduction

   (Please see abstract.)

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Status Recommended for TurboSHAKE128, TurboSHAKE256, KT128, and
    KT256

   (Add text with rationale.)

   Section 5.1 describes the updates needed in the COSE Algorithms
   registry.

3.  MAC Algorithms Based on TurboSHAKE128, TurboSHAKE256, KT128, and
    KT256

   (Add specifications for the HopMACs and for a simple KT based MAC.)

4.  SHA-3 based Algorithms (KMAC etc.)

   [NIST.SP.800-185]


   // What algorithms do we want to register?  Maybe directly include
   // cSHAKE?

5.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Ed.: throughout this section, please replace RFC-XXXX with the
   // RFC number of this specification and remove this note.

5.1.  Updates to the COSE Algorithms Registry

   IANA is requested to update [has updated] the registrations in the
   COSE Algorithms registry in [IANA.cose] shown in Table 1 by setting
   the Recommended status column to Yes, and by adding the present
   document to the Reference column.

   In Table 1, the following columns all have the same content and have
   been elided:

   *  Capabilities: [kty]

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Reference: [RFC9861], RFC-XXXX

   *  Recommended: Yes
